        <h1>My Intro</h1>
    <p class="FloatLeft">
        I am a Business Administration - Human Resources graduate. 
        I have worked in North America, Europe and Africa. 
        I am interested in web development and blockchain because I strongly believe it will be big in the future. 
        In the future I would love to start my own company where I can solve an everyday probolem with the help of leveraging blockchain technology. 
        I am looking forward to learning how to code!
        </p>
